## Local Development using Docker

### Building the Docker Image

#### Build Image for Testing and Development

Our Dockerfile uses a base image and multi-stage builds to allow for creation of a testing and development image that is separate from the production image, which does not contain any test files. **NOTE:** Adding a Python package in requirements.txt will require rebuilding to ensure the new package is contained in the image.

To build the testing and development Docker image for the program, run the following command:

```bash
docker build --target test -t llcsim:dev .
```

This command builds the Docker image using the `test` stage from the Dockerfile and tags it as `llcsim` with the `dev` version.

The image can be run in a container **which will be removed on exit** using the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -it llcsim:dev bash
```
**NOTE:** Do not use this for development or any persistent changes to code. The container is ephemeral and is best suited for troubleshooting and automated testing purposes only.

This image will run the tests automatically using the following command:
```bash
docker run --rm -it llcsim:dev
```

#### Production Image

To build the production Docker image, run the following command:

```bash
docker build --target production -t llcsim:latest .
```

This command builds the production Docker image and tags it as `llcsim` with the `latest` version.

### Running the Docker Container

After building the image, you can run the container using the command:

```bash
docker run --rm llcsim:latest
```

This will run `main.py` and exit. The `--rm` flag ensures that the container is removed after it exits.

## Using Docker Compose

### Starting the Development Environment

To start the development environment, use the following command:
```bash
docker compose up -d dev && docker compose exec dev bash
```

This command does two things:

1. Starts the `dev` service in detached mode (`-d`), allowing you to run it in the background.
1. Executes a bash shell in the running `dev` container, where you can run the program.

Once inside the container, you can execute your main program using:
```bash
python main.py
```

You can run tests using the following:
```bash
python -m unittest
```
This runs all the tests. Run specific tests with the following:

```bash
python -m unittest tests.utils.test_cache_logger
```
Example of running a specific test file - in this case, the the `test_cache_logger.py` file in `/tests/utils`.

It may sometimes be helpful to rebuild to remove any stale images:
```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
```

### Container Behavior
After exiting the shell, the `dev` container will still be running because it was started with a command that keeps it alive. You can stop this container by running:
```bash
docker compose down
```
Or you can connect to the shell again using `docker compose exec dev bash`.

### Running the Main Program
If you want to run the main program directly using `docker compose` and let the container exit upon completion, you can use:
```bash
docker compose up app
```
In this case, the container will run the `app` service defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, execute the program, and then stop when the program finishes.

The `compose.yml` services may be extended in the future to support a `test` service, which could be used in a Github Actions environment.

## Code Quality Tools

We use **Black** for formatting, **Flake8** for linting, and **isort** to maintain consistent dependency import ordering and formatting. This section explains how to run each tool on the `src` directory to check code quality, and how to apply changes if any issues are found.

### Black (Code Formatter)

**Black** is used to automatically format Python code to adhere to a consistent style.

1. **Check Only**: To check if there are any formatting issues without modifying files, run:
```bash
black --check src/
```
or for additional detail:
```bash
black --diff src/
```

2. **Apply Formatting**: To automatically format all files in the `src` directory, run:
```bash
black src/
```

3. **Overriding Automated Formatting**: If there are specific lines or code blocks where you need to override Blackâ€™s automated formatting, you can use `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` comments. Black will skip formatting for code between these markers.
```python
# fmt: off
example = [
    "This", "is", "a", "long", "list", "that", "we", "want", "to", "format",
    "manually", "for", "readability", "even", "though", "Black", "would",
    "normally", "format", "it", "differently"
]
# fmt: on
```

Place `# fmt: off` before the code you want to exclude from formatting, and `# fmt: on` after it. Use these sparingly, as consistent formatting across the codebase is preferred. See the [Black documentation](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#ignoring-sections) for more details.

### Flake8 (Code Linter)

**Flake8** is used to identify potential errors, code style issues, and other coding standard violations.

**Note**: Flake8 does not modify files, so the following command is sufficient to identify any issues that need to be manually addressed.
```bash
flake8 src/
```

### isort (Import Sorter)

**isort** is used to organize imports in Python files.

1. **Check Only**: To check for import order issues without making any changes, run:
```bash
isort --check-only src/
```

2. **Sort Imports**: To automatically sort and organize imports in all Python files within `src`, run:
```bash
isort src/
```

### Git pre-commit hook

The pre-commit hook in `/scripts/hooks` will run on any invocation of `git commit`, and will prevent the commit from completing if any of the pre-commit checks fail. The script currently runs `black`, `isort`, and `flake8`, all in check-only modes to prevent files from being automatically modified. After addressing any issues, you can stage the updated files and retry the commit.

To install the pre-commit hook, you can either run the installation script located at `scripts/install_git_hooks.py`, or manually copy the `pre-commit` script from `scripts/hooks` to your `.git/hooks` directory.
