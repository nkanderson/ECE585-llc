# Test Plan for CacheSet

## Overview
- This test plan covers the verification of the CacheSet class. The main responsibilities of the CacheSet is to store and maintain n-ways of CacheLine Data Classes. Replacement or eviction of a CacheLine is determine by the PLRU algorightm. The CacheSet also implements MESI protocol state tracking for cache coherency.  

**Note: that MESI protocol and state transistion are not part of this test set. Also, a default 16-way set is tested, although CacheSet support n-ways**

## Test Cases and Results

### 1. Constructor Validation Tests (test_constructor_validation)
* Purpose: Verify constructor properly validates num_ways parameter
* Test cases:
  - Valid ways: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]
  - Invalid types: float (2.5), string ("16")
  - Invalid ranges: 0, 33, -1
  - Non-power-of-2: 3
* Status: ‚úÖ PASS

### 2. Initial State Tests (test_initial_state)
* Purpose: Verify initial state of newly created cache set
* Test cases:
  - Verify 16 ways created
  - Verify PLRU state = 0
  - Verify all lines invalid
  - Verify all tags None
* Status: ‚úÖ PASS

### 3. PLRU Behavior Tests
#### 3.1 Basic PLRU Updates (test_plru_update)
* Purpose: Verify basic PLRU bit pattern updates
* Test sequence:
  - Access way 0: 0b000_0000_0000_0000
  - Access way 1: 0b000_0000_1000_0000
  - Access way 8: 0b000_0000_1000_0001
  - Access way 15: 0b100_0000_1100_0101
* Status: ‚úÖ PASS

#### 3.2 Complex PLRU Pattern (test_plru_behavior)
* Purpose: Verify PLRU behavior for complex access patterns
* Test cases:
  1. Sequential Access to All Ways (0-15)
  2. Follow-up accesses to ways 8 and 2
  3. Verify final state: 0b111_0110_1101_1000
* Status: ‚úÖ PASS

### 4. Cache Operations Tests
#### 4.1 Read Operations (test_read_operations)
* Purpose: Verify read hits/misses
* Test cases:
  - Read miss on empty cache
  - Read hit after allocation
  - Read miss on different tag
* Status: ‚úÖ PASS

#### 4.2 Write Operations (test_write_operations)
* Purpose: Verify write hits/misses
* Test cases:
  - Write miss on empty cache
  - Write hit after allocation
  - Write miss on different tag
* Status: ‚úÖ PASS

#### 4.3 Allocation Sequence (test_plru_allocation_sequence)
* Purpose: Verify realistic allocation sequence
* Test sequence:
  1. Sequential allocation (ways 0-15)
  2. Access ways 8 and 2
  3. Final allocation verifying:
     - Correct victim selection (way 12)
     - Proper victim tag (0xC)
     - Expected PLRU state
* Status: ‚úÖ PASS

#### 4.4 Print Valid Cache Lines (test_print_set)
* Purpose: Verify print method only prints valid lines, skips invalid ones
* Test Sequence: 
  1. Load CacheSet with Valid and Invalid Lines
  2. Print CacheSet and perform visual analysis on STDOUT
* Status: ‚úÖ PASS

#### 4.5 Perform Linear Search of Cache Set (find_way_by_tag)
* Purpose: Verify CacheSet way index can be found by tag bits. This is helpful using the getter and setter methods of the MESI bits
* Test Sequence: 
  1. Load CacheSet with lines
  2. Search for those lines by tag 
  3. Confirm returned index matches expected result
* Status: ‚úÖ PASS

#### 4.6 Test getter and setter of MESI Descriptor (test_mesi_state_descriptor)
* Purpose: Verify that getter and setter method provide controlled access to cache line attributes
* Test Sequence: 
 1. Set MESI Bits with setter method
 2. Get MESI Bits with getter method
 3. Assert MESI Bits equal expected result
* Status: ‚úÖ PASS

## Test Coverage Summary
- Total Tests: 7
- Passed: 7
- Failed: 0
- Test Duration: 0.001s
